 \item Blender is a 3D modeling software that also includes a game engine (the Blender Game Engine)
 \item Character animations are known to be slow, which this project attempts to address

Blender is a free and open-source 3D modeling and animation program\cite{blender}.
One of its many features is a built-in game engine called The Blender Game Engine (BGE).
Character animations in the BGE are considered slow, and this work attempts to increase their performance.

Several optimizations are used in this work, which can be grouped into three main categories: parallelizing code, moving code to the GPU, and other minor optimizations.
\todo{Probably should add some more here}
