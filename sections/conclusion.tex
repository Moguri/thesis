\section{Conclusion}
\ifsummaries
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\approx$ 7-8x speedup
 \item Benchmark GPU bound on test system
\end{itemize}

With the benchmark scene described in section~\ref{sec:bench_scene} running on the machine described in section~\ref{sec:bench_platform}, the optimizations presented give approximately a seven to eight times speedup.
Overall, the optimizations presented show a greater performance improvement as more characters are added.
A comparison of frame times between Blender's master Git branch and the branch used for this thesis work is presented in figure~\ref{fig:final_stats}.

On the test machine, the scene is CPU bound when the improvements are taken individually.
However, with all of the improvements, the test scene becomes GPU bound.
In order to further increase performance, the BGE's rendering system as a whole needs to be further optimized, which is outside the scope of this project.
