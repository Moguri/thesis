 \item Benchmark GPU bound on test system

With the benchmark scene described in section~\ref{sec:bench_scene} running on the machine described in section~\ref{sec:bench_platform}, the optimizations presented give approximately a seven to eight times speedup. A comparison of frame times between Blender's master Git branch and the branch used for this thesis work is presented in figure~\ref{final_stats}. \todo{Talk about scaling}

On the test machine, the scene is GPU bound. In order to further increase performance, the BGE's rendering system as a whole needs to be further optimized, which is outside the scope of this project.

% \subsection{Future Work}
% \begin{itemize}
%  \item Rendering performance has to be improved to further increase skeletal mesh performance
%  \item Dual quaternions could be researched for better GPU bandwidth efficiency
