\section{Conclusion}
\ifsummaries
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\approx$ 7-8x speedup
 \item Benchmark GPU bound on test system
\end{itemize}

With the benchmark scene described in section~\ref{sec:bench_scene} running on the machine described in section~\ref{sec:bench_platform}, the optimizations presented give approximately a seven to eight times speedup. On the test machine, the scene is GPU bound. In order to further increase performance, the BGE's rendering system as a whole needs to be further optimized, which is outside the scope of this project.
