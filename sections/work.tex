\subsection{Animation Culling}
\ifsummaries
\begin{itemize}
 \item Don't update animations if the mesh is not visible
 \item Do not cull if the armature has non-mesh children (these are always ``culled'' since they are not drawn)
 \item Culling calculation is already done
 \item Performance gains are variable
\end{itemize}
\fi

The original animation code shown in listing~\ref{lst:anim_code} does not take into account whether the animated object will actually be visible.
This means that animation updates can be performed that have no visual impact, but still consume resources.
Regular object animations are much quicker in comparison to skeletal mesh animations, which means culling them is not as important.
This simplifies the culling calculation since we can make some assumptions about skeletal meshes.
A skeletal mesh should have an armature and zero or more children meshes.
If the armature has any children meshes and all of these child meshes were culled, then we do not need to bother with updating the pose or the mesh since they will not be visible.
An example of what this code (without any of the parallel improvements) looks like is provided in listing~\ref{lst:anim_code_culling}.

\includecpp{anim_code_culling}{BGE animation code with culling}

This adds very little to the overall cost of the animation code since the mesh culling is already being done.
However, if some pose and mesh updates can be avoided we can save a fair amount of time.
The exact savings is difficult to calculate since it is view dependent.

This optimization has already been committed to Blender's master branch and was included as part of the 2.69 release.

\subsection{Bundled RNA Lookups}
\ifsummaries
\begin{itemize}
 \item Animation in Blender modifies RNA values
 \item RNA array values were doing a slow lookup for each array element
 \item Array values can be bundled into one lookup
 \item ~1.5x performance improvement on large benchmark scene
\end{itemize}
\fi

As discussed in section~\ref{sec:bf_dna_rna}, updating poses requires using RNA to modify values, which can be slow.
Looking up the RNA property is one of the more expensive parts of the RNA writing step.
Every channel (e.g., X Position, Y Position, Z Position, etc) was being looked up as a separate property.
However, RNA supports looking up and modifying an array (e.g., Position).
Therefore, time can be saved by modifying arrays (one lookup per three to four writes) at a time instead of each channel individually (one lookup per one write).
The performance improvement is shown in figure~\ref{fig:stats_rna}.

\subsection{Multithreading}
\subsubsection{Parallel Pose Updates}
\ifsummaries
\begin{itemize}
 \item Copy bArmature and bAction data
 \item Give BL\_ArmatureObject control over poses
 \item Parallelize with OpenMP parallel for
\end{itemize}
\fi

The juggling of the bPose reference of bArmature described in section~\ref{sec:bge_anim_overview} saves memory, but it can cause race conditions when attempting to perform the pose updates in parallel.
If multiple ArmatureObjects share a single reference to a bArmature, and then those ArmatureObjects attempt to modify their bArmature simultaneously, problems will occur.
Therefore, in order to avoid the race conditions, it is better that each ArmatureObject not only has a unique copy of the bPose, but a unique copy of the bArmature as well.
The copy does consume a little more memory, but it makes threading the animation code possible.
Another potential race condition involved the bAction data stored by the Action class.
This bAction data does get modified during animation updates, so it was best that each Action object held its own copy of the bAction data to avoid potential race conditions.

%A simple OpenMP parallel for construct was used to parallelize the loop found in Scene::UpdateAnimations().
%This construct also provides various scheduling options, that could be explored for better load balancing of the threads since some iterations of the loop that are not updating skeletal mesh animations will be completed much quicker.

Initially, OpenMP\cite{openmp} was used to parallelize this loop using an OpenMP parallel for pragma.
While OpenMP was simple to use, OpenMP support is compiler dependent since it relies on pragmas.
Since OpenMP is implemented at the compiler level, support can vary (e.g., different OpenMP versions), and performance is not equivalent across compilers.
For example,  MSVC 2010 introduced a performance regression with OpenMP code that could cause code to run two times slower than MSVC 2008\cite{msvcompreg}.

Recently, a threaded task scheduler was added to Blender named BLI\_task\cite{blitask}.
This opened up an alternative to OpenMP that was not as compiler dependent.
Furthermore, BLI\_task could be used for other parts of the BGE.
Therefore, the code was switched from OpenMP to BLI\_task, which can be seen in listing~\ref{lst:anim_code_mt}.
There was no discernible difference in performance between BLI\_task and OpenMP on the test platform (section~\ref{sec:bench_platform}).

\subsubsection{Parallel Software Skinning}
\label{sec:parallel_software_skinning}
\ifsummaries
\begin{itemize}
 \item Move code from BL\_SkinDeformer::Apply() to BL\_SkinDeformer::Update()
 \item Parallelize with OpenMP parallel for
 \item Combined with Parallel Pose Updates loop
\end{itemize}
\fi

The skinning step was not already in an easy-to-parallelize loop like the pose update.
Another problem with the software skinning is that it is counted under the ``Rasterizer'' category in the profiler discussed in section~\ref{sec:bge_profiler}.
It would be ideal to perform the skinning step in the same loop as the pose updates (Scene::UpdateAnimations()), as this solves both problems (the loop is already running in parallel, and is already being recorded as ``Animation'' time).
As discussed in section~\ref{sec:bge_anim_overview}, SkinDeformer::Apply() is essentially the entry point for the software skinning.

Unfortunately, SkinDeformer::Apply() requires a IPolyMaterial pointer, which is part of the rasterizer code and not something that Scene::UpdateAnimations() has access to.
However, SkinDeformer::Update() has no arguments, and none of the skinning code requires the IPolyMaterial pointer.
Thus, skinning code could be moved from SkiinDeformer::Apply() to SkinDeformer::Update() and SkinDeformer::Update() could be called in the Scene::UpdateAnimation() loop.
It does not matter if this update is called multiple times (e.g., once in Scene::UpdateAnimations() and again in the rasterizer) since it contains a guard to only do skinning if there has been a pose update since the last call to SkinDeformer::Update().
Since a pose can only be updated at most once per frame, the skinning step should happen at most once per frame regardless of how many times SkinDeformer::Update() is called.

It could be argued that the skinning code could have just be moved from SkinDeformer::Apply() to Scene::UpdateAnimations(), but this breaks the encapsulation of SkinDeformer, which is best avoided.
The Scene does not need to know of the details of the mesh deformation caused by skinning, just that it needs to be performed.

The performance improvement from both the parallel pose updates and the parallel software skinning are shown in figure~\ref{fig:stats_mt}.

\subsection{Hardware Skinning}
\ifsummaries
\begin{itemize}
 \item Needed to reuse existing vertex generation code in Blender
 \item Implemented new deformer type for BL\_SkinDeformer for hardware skinning
 \item Limits: 4 bone influences per vertex, min(128, GL\_MAX\_VERTEX\_UNIFORM\_COMPONENTS/2) bones per mesh
 \item Fallback to software skinning if hardware cannot handle the skinning
 \item TBOs researched to overcome bone limit, but not supported on older cards that could benefit from it
 \item Requires GLSL mode, doesn't work with shadows
\end{itemize}
\fi

\label{sec:hardware_skinning}

To implement hardware skinning, a new vertex deformer type was added to the SkinDeformer, and each vertex deformer was made responsible for its own data.
Previously, the Blender and BGE vertex deformers handled vertex data in similar ways, but hardware skinning does not need to copy data on the CPU before sending that data to the GPU.
Currently the bone data is sent to the GPU as a uniform array of four-by-four transform matrices.
New member functions were added to SkinDeformer to send the necessary uniform and attribute data to the graphics card.
This allows the SkinDeformer to handle preparing the data, but allows the rasterizer to control when that data is sent to the GPU (i.e., when the OpenGL state is properly setup).

The modifications to Blender's vertex shader were based on NVIDIA code shown in listing~\ref{lst:nv_skinning}.
The modified vertex shader fragment can be found in listing~\ref{lst:gpu_shader_vertex}.

\includeglsl{gpu_shader_vertex}{Blender's vertex shader modified for hardware skinning}

The \texttt{usehwskin} uniform is always sent as zero.
Any code wanting to make use of hardware skinning can later set it to one, which happens in SkinDeformer.
Along with the \texttt{usehwskin} uniform, the SkinDeformer must handle the \texttt{bonematrices} uniform and the \texttt{weight}, \texttt{index} and \texttt{numbones} vertex attributes.
The performance improvement for hardware skinning can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:stats_hws}

\fig{imgs/stats_hws}{0.5}{Results of RNA and hardware skinning improvements}{stats_hws}

\subsubsection{Uniform Components and Bone Limitations}

In OpenGL/GLSL, there is a hardware limit on the number of uniform components that a shader can use.
A ``component'' is essentially a float, so every float sent as a uniform to a shader uses up a component.
In order to leave components for the rest of Blender's vertex shader, the bone matrix data of the hardware skinning needs ensure that it does not use too many of the available components.
To leave enough components for other parts of the vertex shader, an arbitrary limit is placed on the bone matrix data to only use half of the available components.
Modern (shader model 4+) GPUs typically have 4096 components, which would give 2048 components for bone matrices, which allows for 128 matrices (a four-by-four matrix is sixteen components).
Older GPUs tend to have 1024 components or less, giving a maximum of only 64 bone matrices on these graphics cards, but still leaves 512 components for other uniforms.
512 components is enough for Blender's current vertex shader and leaves ample room for future additions to the vertex shader.
Further work could be done to find a smarter limit on components to squeeze more bones onto older GPUs.

Texture buffer objects (TBOs) could be used to work around component limits\cite{ARB_texture_buffer_object}, but they are not supported on the older GPUs that would benefit from them, and 128 matrices is a reasonable limit on bones for the newer GPUs that support TBOs.
TBOs could potentially be used to support unlimited (bounded by texture memory) bones, but then separate code would need to be maintained for hardware skinning on different GPUs.

\subsubsection{Other Limitations}

When using hardware skinning, each vertex can only have four bones influencing it.
This limitation should work well enough in most cases.
If a vertex has more than four bones influencing it, the four most influential bones are selected and their corresponding weights re-normalized (this is done in the SkinDeformer).
Hardware skinning also requires a specific vertex shader, and as such only works with the BGE's GLSL material mode, and currently does not support custom shaders.
If hardware skinning cannot be used (e.g., if the skeleton has too many bones), the skinning falls back to software skinning using the BGE vertex deformer.
